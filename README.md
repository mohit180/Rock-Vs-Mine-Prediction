# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction

Rock vs Mine Prediction Classification Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting whether an object detected in sonar returns is a rock or a mine. The dataset used for this project is the Sonar dataset, which comprises sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder (a mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock.

Project Overview:
In this project, we utilize supervised learning techniques to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. The classification task involves processing sonar return data and building a model capable of distinguishing between the two classes based on the provided features.

Dataset:
The Sonar dataset used in this project consists of 208 observations with 60 features each. Each feature represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period. The dataset has been preprocessed and normalized, making it suitable for various machine learning algorithms.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a binary classification problem of distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar signals. By leveraging various algorithms and thorough evaluation, we aim to develop a robust model capable of accurate predictions. The insights gained from this project can be further extended to similar classification tasks in various domains.
